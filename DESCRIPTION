Description: The haversine is a function used to calculate the distance between a pair of 
    latitude and longitude points while accounting for the assumption that the points 
    are on a spherical globe. This package provides a fast, dataframe compatible, 
    haversine function. For the first publication on the haversine calculation see
    <https://books.google.cat/books?id=030t0OqlX2AC>.
    For an example of the derivation of haversine see the reply by Doctor Rick on
    this email thread <http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51879.html>.
    Implimentation of haversine in various programming languages are available 
    on rosettacode <https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula>.
